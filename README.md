This is a way to help me understand Coq (Programming language).

Some algorithms are not from me. I copy them from the book (Coq book) for learning
purpose. Most of the exercises i solved are mark with (* exercise: _ star... *) or
just with (* exercise ... *).

There are also some features like "Compute", "Check"... for test purpose.
